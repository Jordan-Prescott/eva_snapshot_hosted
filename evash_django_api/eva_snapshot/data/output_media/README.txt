Hello!

Thank you for downloading the EVA Snapshot, this is how your agent is currenly configured to handle requests showing you 
what EVA will say, where it will transfer a call, and what SMS information it will send. 

# How to use

The EVA Snapshot contains five images labelled 01 - 05, these give you valuable information on how EVAs flows are presented 
and how to interpret them. The next set of files are stored in the flows/ folder, these files show you how EVA is designed to 
handle requests such as airport. 

Files in flows/ are file type SVG meaning you will need to open them with a browser, this gives you features from the browser such as
zoom or cmd/ ctrl + f to search. 

Before you look at the flows please view all images 01 to 05, this will give you the information needed for you to best understand 
the information in each flow.
